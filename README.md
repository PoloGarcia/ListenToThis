This project is all about music and sharing it, with the people that loves music. 

How does this works?

Easy. We provide you 3 basic views that will contain your entire application or hopefully will help you to build upon it, this are the 3 views:

| View  |Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| index.php  | Here users of your app can subscribe or unsuscribe to your playlist newsletter  |
| login.php  | Here you login to the admin.php view|
| admin.php  | Only accesible through login.php, here you can add music to collections, create new collections, change your spotify profile and of course send the newsletter email  |

So this is basically it, as we stated early, hope this can help you build a much better application for the people who loves music. You can even create a musical social network. SKY IS THE LIMIT.
